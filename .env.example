# Example environment variables (do NOT commit secrets)
# If you run a backend proxy for AI services, set your server-side key here.
# No client-side environment variables are required for this project.
# If you add a server/proxy for external services, store secrets on the server
# and do not commit them into source control.

# Example (server-side only):
# MY_SERVER_API_KEY=
